Venomous snakes can pose a serious threat to human health and safety, making it essential to be able to identify and distinguish between different species. Traditional methods of snake classification rely on morphological features, which can be time-consuming and often require expert knowledge. In recent years, however, deep learning techniques have shown great promise in accurately classifying different species of venomous snakes based on their visual features.

The aim of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify a variety of venomous snake species. By training the model on a large dataset of high-quality images, we hope to create a robust classifier that can identify the subtle differences in coloration, patterns, and scales that distinguish one species from another. Our ultimate goal is to provide a reliable and efficient tool that can be used by researchers, wildlife conservationists, and snake enthusiasts alike to improve our understanding of these fascinating but dangerous animals.
